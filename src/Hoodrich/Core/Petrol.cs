    /// A MOD'S PROP CAR IS NOT A CAR. The takeover parks a row of them across the junction
    /// with their engines and their radios held on, because a car with a dead engine has no
    /// radio and the music IS the party; the car meet's lowrider is the sound system for the
    /// same reason; the boombox is an invisible car under a speaker prop. None of them is
    /// ever driven, nobody is ever in one, and not one of them is a vehicle in any sense the
    /// player would recognise -- they are furniture with a stereo in.
    ///
    /// AND FUMES WAS TAKING THEIR PETROL. It watches every vehicle in the world, an idling
    /// engine burns, and a parked prop idles for the length of a party -- so the tank emptied
    /// and Fumes cut the engine, which is exactly what it is for. Then the takeover's own
    /// five-second pass turned it straight back on, because the music had stopped. Off, on,
    /// off, on, for as long as anybody stood there. Neither mod was wrong; they were answering
    /// different questions about the same car.
    ///
    /// So one of them has to say which. This is the channel: the mod that put the car there
    /// marks it, and Fumes leaves it alone -- no tank, no gauge, no prompt at a pump and no
    /// fuel burned, because Covers is its one gate.
    ///
    /// THE HANDLE AND THE MODEL, NOT THE HANDLE. The game reuses entity handles, so a handle
    /// on its own would eventually exempt somebody's actual car; the model is stored with it
    /// and both have to match. Entries whose vehicle has gone are dropped as they are found.
    ///
    /// Same channel as everything else the set shares: SHVDN loads every script into one
    /// AppDomain, so data parked there is visible to all of them. See UI.Ledger, which does
    /// the same for the rectangle budget.
